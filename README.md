- Retrieves top 5 visually similar dresses from pre-indexed embeddings

### ‚úÖ Outcome 2: Personalized Recommendations
- Tracks your uploaded image history
- Extracts dominant features (color, style, cloth material, brand)
- Recommends based on recurring patterns in your search behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Why We Did What We Did

| Challenge                        | Solution                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Imbalanced brand representation  | Hybrid sampling: undersample oversampled brands, enhance rare ones      |
| Missing data in metadata         | Constructed robust `text_description` using available fields             |
| Slow/unstable embedding          | Batched embedding + caching with FAISS and `.npy` metadata               |
| Redundant image usage            | Embedded fewer images for oversampled brands, more for underrepresented |
| Dynamic personalization          | TF-IDF similarity on history-based descriptions                         |
| Trend logic too strict           | Loosened filters + fallback to most recent similar dresses               |
